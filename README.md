# Consequences of Incarceration for Mortality

This repository contains the code and simulation exercise discussed on the paper *The Consequences of Incarceration for Mortality in the US*.

- Reproduction code
    - Look at the folder `src`
    - There are 3 folders: `psid`, `nlsy`, `utils`
    - The file `run_code.R` runs all code to reproduce the analysis
    - Some of the PSID data we used are restricted, and was obtained under special contractual arrangements to protect the anonymity of respondents. These data are not available from the authors. Those interested in obtaining PSID restricted data should contact PSIDHelp@isr.umich.edu
- A simple simulation to validate our modeling strategy is [here](simulation/simulation.ipynb)
- The `output` folder contains tables, figures and temporary data files
- A pre-print version of the paper is available [here](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b8xe6/)
