This repository contains the code and simulation exercise discussed on the paper.

- Reproduction code
    - Look at the folder `src`
    - File `run_code.R` will run all the code to reproduce analysis
    - There are 3 folders:
        - psid
        - nlys
        - utils
- A simple simulation to validate our modeling strategy is [here](simulation/simulation.ipynb)
- The `output` folder contains tables, figures and temporary data files
- A pre-print version of the paper is available [here](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b8xe6/)
